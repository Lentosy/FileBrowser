# FileBrowser
A handy tool to gather files you care about in one spot. It scans a list of predefined folders you can chose and produces a flat list of the deep content in that folder, for extensions that you are interested in. I use it primarily for music files that are scattered all around the filesystem. I have not tested it extensively because it just works for me and have not had any issues since. 

I can't be bothered to make changes or finetune it anymore since it works as I want it to. However, if you have a great idea or have some annoying bug I will fix it.
